# About
This is for blocking Steam Deck spam news sites from appearing search engines results. To be used with Ublock Origin.

Why? With more and more sites chasing SEO (Search Engine Optimization), most search engines results are becoming a mess of ridiculous clickbait. It makes finding anything interesting, and what you actually what, a complete nightmare. So I decided to do something about it for my sanity.

# How To Use

* Go into Ublock Origin Settings
* Paste from the [LIST](https://github.com/LiamDawe/steamdeck_spamblock/blob/main/LIST) file into the "My filters" tab

There's also the [PLAIN_LIST](https://github.com/LiamDawe/steamdeck_spamblock/blob/main/PLAIN_LIST) file just for the URLs if you wish to use it elsewhere.

# Contributing

* To have a site accepted in a pull request, please list examples of their spamminess.
* Please add the site to the PLAIN_LIST as well in your PR.

# What Search Engines Are Accepted?

Any! As long as the rules added actually work, it can be accepted and added.
